# Understanding Underfitting and Overfitting in Machine Learning

This repository explores the critical challenges of **underfitting** and **overfitting** in machine learning and provides practical insights into how to address these issues. These concepts are demonstrated through visualizations using polynomial regression models, with varying degrees of complexity, to understand the trade-offs between bias and variance.

## Key Topics Covered

1. **What is Underfitting?**
   - Causes: Simplistic models, insufficient training, and low flexibility.
   - Symptoms: High training error and poor performance on both training and test datasets.
   - Solutions: Increase model complexity, add relevant features, and extend training duration.

2. **What is Overfitting?**
   - Causes: Excessively complex models, small or noisy datasets, and irrelevant features.
   - Symptoms: Low training error but high test error due to poor generalization.
   - Solutions: Use regularization, cross-validation, pruning, and dropout techniques.

3. **Visual Demonstration**
   - Polynomial regression models with degrees 1, 4, and 15 demonstrate the impact of underfitting, appropriate fitting, and overfitting.
   - Visualizations highlight how model complexity affects bias and variance.

4. **Best Practices**
   - Data splitting for training, validation, and testing.
   - Feature selection and early stopping techniques.
   - Data augmentation to increase dataset diversity.
